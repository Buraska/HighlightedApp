# Highlighted - Book Reading and Note-taking App

Highlighted is a minimal viable product designed to enhance your reading experience and simplify the process of summarizing and note-taking. This application seamlessly combines a .NET backend with a Vue.js frontend.

## Key Features

- User Registration

- Add and Read Books: Add books to your personal library. You can also add categories to the book.

- Quote and Define: While reading, highlight and categorize text passages as either quotes or dictionary words for quick reference.

- Take Notes: Jot down your thoughts, ideas, and summaries while reading to create a comprehensive collection of notes.

## Purpose and Inspiration

Highlighted was developed as a showcase of my expertise in developing with .NET and Vue.js frameworks. It serves as a prime example of building an application using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community to improve and expand Highlighted. Whether you're interested in design, development, or documentation, your input is highly valued.
